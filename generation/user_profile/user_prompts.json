It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \\n\\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \\n\\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \\n\\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.\"}, {\"title\": \"Taqueria Pico De Gallo\", \"description\": \"Mexican food enthusiasts looking for fresh, flavorful tacos with homemade tortillas, delicious shrimp and fish options, and unique toppings like pickled onions would enjoy Taqueria Pico De Gallo in Tucson.\", \"feedback\": \"During my visit last week, I ate so many shrimp tacos I couldn't walk. In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. \\n\\nDuring dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: \\n\\nTortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \\n\\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \\n\\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \\n\\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \\n\\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \\n\\nPina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. \\n\\nTaqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?\"}, {\"title\": \"Barrio Brewing\", \"description\": \"Fans of spacious trendy bars with a variety of games, good beer selection, delicious food, and attentive service would enjoy Barrio Brewing in Tucson.\", \"feedback\": \"Love the location, ambiance, roomy bar, happy hour, pups on the patio, classic bike night, the suds (always The Blonde), and rail pints of said suds.

Don't play it fast and loose, don't tempt fate, I assure you that YOU CANNOT GET THIS BURRITO AFTER 10:30 AM. \\n\\nYou definitely can't get it at 10:35 AM, even if you're starving for sustenance because you got lost and had to Bear-Grylls it down Starr Pass, show up panting and red-faced, and all but beg for the burro. Depending on who is working, you might not be able to get it at 10:28 AM. THE BREAKFAST DEADLINE IS STRICTLY ENFORCED. VIOLATORS WILL GO HOME HUNGRY.\\n\\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, the burrito is delicious, but it's just not that breakfasty. As someone who exalts Nico's as bacon-egg-cheese and potato as the paradigmatic breakfast-bundle, I obviously have more traditional tastes. Here's my take:\\n\\nI ordered St. Mary's burrito with carne seca, eggs, potato, and cheese. You can hardly discern the presence of the egg, it's so thoroughly incorporated into the carne seca. You won't find slightly steaming, toothsome, eggy pillows hanging out on their own here. Here, the eggy morsels, no larger than the head of a pin, resurrect the dried beef, giving it a moisture and depth of flavor that is lacking in carne seca alone. The potatoes are perfectly cooked and uniformly diced, and in proportion to the carne seca/egg combo, such that each bite yields just the right amount of both. The cheese, your standard yellow, makes a pleasantly oily, oozing introduction halfway through the burrito, taking it to the next level of richness at exactly the right time. Everything is working, nothing is going wrong. \\n\\nSo, why not a full five stars? Have I gone against everything Public Enemy taught me and fallen victim to the hype? Were my expectations unrealistically high? Perhaps, but I think it's more likely that this burrito showed me what St. Mary's carne seca could be with more moisture and seasoning. Also, because there wasn't enough egg to render this my perfect breakfast burrito. Still, it's worth having, and worth having frequently, provided you can get your order in before the deadline.\"}]}"}

Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late).
