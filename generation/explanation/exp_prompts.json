The syrups they throw in the iced teas are wonderful, especially the Mojito Mint. \n\nThe outdoor seating is deceiving. It is always too hot or too cold to sit out there, so it's basically a waste. In the summer, you only hear the loud air conditioner and there is no wind to cool off the area. The inside has all of three tables, but there's usually so much turnover that you can find a seat. There are two nice outdoor tables in the front right on Fairmount that are great for people watching and dog petting. \n\nFree and unlimited WiFi!\n\nOverall, a very good sandwich shop with decent prices."}}

There are dozens of pods within walking distance, and in some center-city spots they have taken over entire lots with their green-painted parking spaces.  Booking at the last minute is easy, although sometimes it means a bit more walking.\n\nI have always been happy with their customer service and the people on the phone are extremely nice and helpful.  I've never had a complaint.  Nor have I had much problem with their website, which is very nice and slick, and really useful and user-friendly.  \n\nIt's a little weird having a deadline for getting the car back.  It's not really that much of a problem, but it does make make trips feel a little more rushed.  I suppose that is our fault--we admittedly don't give ourselves much padding in order to save money--but it still fe"}}

I was new to the neighborhood, they were new to the neighborhood, it was love at first sight, yaddayaddyadda...I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE STRAWBERRIES.\n\nWe've both evolved. I moved to the West Coast and did some soul-searching, and this farmer's market tripled while I was away!\n\nIt's still great, though. They offer free yoga in the early morning. They have that awesome fountain going off for the kiddos. You can shop for top-notch produce AND grab some iced coffee and a fresh crepe (or pastry or yummy bread from any one of many bakeries present...I also saw some 25-cent lemonade!). There's a mushroom booth with some of the most mouth-watering mushrooms I've ever set eyes on (I walked away with Truffle Mushroom Butter....oh, so good....). A lot of the booths carry similar items, but they all offer something unique, as well. \n\nLast time I went, I walked away with a container of organic peaches, another of fingerling potatoes that I simply c"}}

The cauliflower bezul had a very fragrant coconut sauce, but I wish the breading was thinner.  The lunch thali came in generous portions and the price was fine for the area.  However, I didn't find the chicken tikka masala or the palak lamb to be very flavorful.  I also didn't like the texture of the chicken tikka masala, which was too soft from being braised in the sauce for too long.  The naan appeared to be made with whole wheat flour, which is healthier, but didn't have that super soft and fluffy texture that I am used."}}
{"uid": 10093, "iid": 4609, "feedback": {"review": "The Seed is a ground-breaking spot for the Reno alternative scene - it offers a non-typical menu for those who want to be surprised and treated with something both healthy and yummy. Contrary to the general understanding that food needs to be cooked before it's considered worthy of being appetizing, The Seed offers all raw items that are prepared with care and attention to detail. Their ingredients are, from what I understand, mostly organic so for that combination, the price will be over average. For a slice of cake, I've paid around $5. \nOverall, the experience is worth every bite - you truly get to taste food in it's beautiful raw state, but you'll never be able to tell."}}

The food is ALWAYS fantastic, and the service is wonderful too. \n\nI like sweet wine personally so I get their Riesling by the glass. It is superb and it is the perfect level of chilled. Also their wine glasses have their logo right on the pour line so its fun to see how perfect their pour is each time.\n\nThe Food:\n\nI usually get the Bruschetta with the Mozzarella Crema. Yum! The white bean hummus dip thingy is amazing too.\n\nAlso their salads are fresh and tasty.\n\nFor a place that has ambiance, yummy food and is right in the center of it all, the prices seem extremely reasonable to me."}}
