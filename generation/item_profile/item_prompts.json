It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \\n\\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \\n\\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \\n\\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.\", \"I was told this place is a must for a Sonoran hot dog. I was visiting from out of town and had never had one. It was good, but the whole Sonoran hot dog isn't really my thing (too many components for me) so I can't say it was great. The guacamole on the other hand, was great! I also had the taco combo - the chicken and carne asada were very good but the cabeza was slimy. BK has a salsa bar that allows you to help yourself to your own toppings and I appreciated that. Service was good, food arrived quickly. It was pretty packed during lunch on a weekday.\", 'My favorite meal in Tucson.  The sonoran hot dog was outstanding.  I was unhappy with the food in Tucson until I are here.  You must try it, yum!', \"I usually visit Bks for lunch and did not realize it is a seated restaurant for dinner. A lively bar scene close to campus without the hassle of being on campus. \\n\\nThe Sonoran dogs are a must try. The service was lacking. Our server, Lorena,  was rude and didn't refill our drinks once. Then at the end of the meal she asked if we needed anything else. My recommendation is to go for the food and not have expectations of good service for dinner time.\"]"}
{"iid": 1, "prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{'name': 'Good Karma Cafe', 'city': 'Philadelphia', 'categories': 'Food, Cafes, Coffee & Tea, Restaurants'}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\"My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.\", \"This is the perfect place to study! There are tons of tables, and some outlets (come with devices charged just in case you can't sit by one!) Good Karma always has seasonal specials like the iced lavender latte I have had twice this week. They also now take credit cards, so I will be coming back even more.\", \"Good Karma is a nice spot, and conveniently located (on the way to PATCO for me), so I stop by frequently. The coffee is good, if not great, but you get a lot of customization options to make something you'll definitely enjoy. Though most of the baked goods here are the pre-packaged variety, Good Karma definitely gets points on the food front for its bagels, which you can order with anything from hummus to salmon to eggs. \\n\\nThe other selling point of the location is its spaciousness. The layout of tables makes it a near certainty that you'll find a spot to sit, so if you're looking for a place to read or check your email, Good Karma has you covered.\\n\\nThe final point in favor is the underused backyard seating. I had one particular breakfast back there on a beautiful day that was very memorable.\", \"Nice place to refuel and soak up some good karma on the walk from the Italian Market to the Reading Terminal Market. Saturday morning adventures. This is not a chain, it doesn't look like anywhere else! we sat outside in back and listened to the sound of the fountain. Pretty nice and good coffee\"]"}

If you are looking for something to do on  Friday night that is reasonably priced and extremely entertaining then see the N Crowd, The improv comedy group that makes you glad you came out to see their show.', \"Great place to start a Friday night. They put on a great show for a very reasonable price. Who's line is it anyway style show, so a lot of the material relies on good suggestions from the audience.

Always a fun time though as long as you go ready to laugh.\", \"Had an awesome experience last night at the N Crowd. The actors were all great and it's an intimate setting of about twenty or so people so you are definitely part of the show wherever you land in the audience. The show started on time and although there were a few oblivious patrons who left their phones on the actors incorporated it into the show seamlessly. The moderators were great and also part of the show, which lasted just shy of ninety minutes. There were no lulls and everyone there seemed to enjoy the show. There was definitely something for everyone and all suggestions were used.\"]"}

I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!\", 'I love the Coventry Deli.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it should be called a cafeteria just because of the selection they offer.  And everyone really is great, very kind, and helpful.  \\n\\nMy go-to is the sandwich counter.  I had consulted Yelp before I ever walked in and decided there was no way a \"half\" sandwich would suffice for my lunch despite what was said in several reviews.. and I was wrong.  First, and foremost, the half sandwiches are just smaller portions of full sandwiches, not actually half a sandwich.  For example, if you order a whole egg salad sandwich, you\\'re going to have a 4\" tall egg salad sandwich on your hands, whereas a half egg salad sandwhich is a more managable 2-3\" tall.  I eat a lot, and the half sandwich is plenty.  The sandwiches also come with a side.  I recommend the spicy potato salad personally, but all their side salads are pretty good, and you can also get a piece of fruit or chips.  \\n\\nThe interesting assortment of brownies and cake slices strategically placed at the cash registers are quite tasty and usually won\\'t dissapoint.  \\n\\nI found the oatmeal selection in the mornings to be too sweet for my taste, but it seems quite popular.  \\n\\nOverall, this is a great place for a to-go lunch (and on occasion breakfast) where -you\\'ll have lots of options and friendly folks.', \"Recently started working in center city and when I found this gem I came 3 days in a row! This place is built for the corporate lunch rush. They are as efficient as can be with so many options and people coming in with custom sandwich orders. All the staff are very kind (even when you are standing around overwhelmed with so many options). There's some seating inside and a covered area outside too. I will definitely be back and whether you're the kind of person to stick to your usual sandwich order or try something new every time, this is the place for you! Never underestimate a good deli!\", 'I\\'ve never eaten inside the establishment, but my company orders catering from here frequently for luncheons and breakfast spreads.  \\n\\nThe food is always fresh and presented beautifully.  The sandwiches, coleslaw, and potato salad are delicious and filling.  \\n\\nThe \"mini breakfast\" is my go-to catering order for meetings that require breakfast. Everything\\'s in manageable portions and gives a good sampling of mini bagels, danishes, muffins, and sticky buns (which are all tasty).\\n\\nCost is reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food and the delivery is speedy and hassle-free.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend Coventry for your catering needs.']"}
{"iid": 4, "prompt": "BASIC INFORMATION: \n{'name': 'Jasmine Rice - Rittenhouse', 'city': 'Philadelphia', 'categories': 'Soup, Thai, Restaurants, Salad'}\nUSER FEEDBACK: \n[\"It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.\", \"Had a nice, quiet dinner here last Wednesday and would certainly recommend. Our reservation was not necessary as only a few other patrons cycled through the restaurant throughout the evening, but since it's a fairly small space, it's probably not a bad idea to make a reservation just in case (and especially on a weekend).\\n \\nThe service was friendly and unobtrusive, and the interior of the restaurant feels homey and intimate. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted, seated, and provided an ice bucket for our BYO bottle of white. We lingered a while after dinner to finish the wine and did not feel unwelcome or rushed at all. And dinner itself was very good; my green curry was just the right amount of spicy, and the portions were small enough to finish but large enough to be filling. Great place for a casual evening on a quiet block near Rittenhouse!\", 'Very very good restaurant! The food was sooo good and the service was great too!!!! Definitely coming back again:))', 'I visited last week. The food was delicious! I ordered the lemongrass soup and the pad thai. Very tasty and lovely presentation. I definitely would recommend it.']"}

Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.  \\n\\nEvery time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.  \\n\\nKid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.  \\n\\nMy go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.  \\n\\nTried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.\", \"I have visited the brewpub several times now, and I'm finally ready to write up a review.  I really like the decor here.  It's old-school brewpub with lots of games for children.  The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.  \\nThe food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).  It's also great to get the ploughman's plate and a beer, and just relax for a bit.\", \"I love the Brewpub. It's a great place for hanging out with friends in the evenings you don't want to deal with the craziness of the Broad Ripple strip. It just has a really nice, cozy, laid-back feel. The beers are excellent - I highly recommend getting a sampler. The food is also really just really good pub food and lots of options on the menu. I remember the shepherd's pie I got reminded me of food I ate in the United Kingdom - very authentic!\", 'Been to Broadripple Brew Pub many times. This place is always packed! There is usually a wait, but its totally worth it. Its a traditional Irish Pub with a twist. They have many typical Irish dishes, but also have pizza and other options as well. You HAVE to try the scottish eggs. They are probably the best Ive ever had! \\n\\nPrices are reasonable, atmosphere is great, service is usually pretty good. We had an issue with our server the last time we were there, she obviously did not want to be there. Other than that its typically been a great experience.']"}
